Predictive Analytics on Global Terrorism Dataset from Kaggle using Python and Machine Learning

The world is experiencing an era where terrorist attacks are becoming prevalent in various parts of the globe. Every nation is trying hard to strengthen their counter terrorism strategies, policies and defense operations to tackle the menace of terrorism. The world is reeling from a wave of deadly terrorist attacks. The prime responsibility of every nation is to provide security to its citizens from such attacks.
